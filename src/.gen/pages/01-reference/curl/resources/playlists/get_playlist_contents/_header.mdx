## Get Playlist Contents

<OperationInfo method='get' path='/playlists/{playlistID}/items' />

Gets the contents of a playlist. Should be paged by clients via standard mechanisms. 
By default leaves are returned (e.g. episodes, movies). In order to return other types you can use the `type` parameter. 
For example, you could use this to display a list of recently added albums vis a smart playlist. 
Note that for dumb playlists, items have a `playlistItemID` attribute which is used for deleting or moving items.
