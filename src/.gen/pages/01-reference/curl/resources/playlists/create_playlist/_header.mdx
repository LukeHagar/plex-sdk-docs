## Create Playlist

<OperationInfo method='post' path='/playlists' />

Create a new playlist. By default the playlist is blank. To create a playlist along with a first item, pass:
- `uri` - The content URI for what we're playing (e.g. `server://1234/com.plexapp.plugins.library/library/metadata/1`).
- `playQueueID` - To create a playlist from an existing play queue.
