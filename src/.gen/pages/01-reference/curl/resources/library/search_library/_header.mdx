## Search Library

<OperationInfo method='get' path='/library/sections/{sectionId}/search' />

Search for content within a specific section of the library.

### Types
Each type in the library comes with a set of filters and sorts, aiding in building dynamic media controls:

- **Type Object Attributes**:
  - `type`: Metadata type (if standard Plex type).  
  - `title`: Title for this content type (e.g., "Movies").

- **Filter Objects**:
  - Subset of the media query language.
  - Attributes include `filter` (name), `filterType` (data type), `key` (endpoint for value range), and `title`.

- **Sort Objects**:
  - Description of sort fields.
  - Attributes include `defaultDirection` (asc/desc), `descKey` and `key` (sort parameters), and `title`.

> **Note**: Filters and sorts are optional; without them, no filtering controls are rendered.
