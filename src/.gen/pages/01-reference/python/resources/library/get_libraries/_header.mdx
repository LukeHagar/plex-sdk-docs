## Get Libraries

A library section (commonly referred to as just a library) is a collection of media. 
Libraries are typed, and depending on their type provide either a flat or a hierarchical view of the media. 
For example, a music library has an artist > albums > tracks structure, whereas a movie library is flat.

Libraries have features beyond just being a collection of media; for starters, they include information about supported types, filters and sorts. 
This allows a client to provide a rich interface around the media (e.g. allow sorting movies by release year).
