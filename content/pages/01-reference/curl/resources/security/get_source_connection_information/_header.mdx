## Get Source Connection Information

<OperationInfo method='get' path='/security/resources' />

If a caller requires connection details and a transient token for a source that is known to the server, for example a cloud media provider or shared PMS, then this endpoint can be called. This endpoint is only accessible with either an admin token or a valid transient token generated from an admin token.
Note: requires Plex Media Server >= 1.15.4.
