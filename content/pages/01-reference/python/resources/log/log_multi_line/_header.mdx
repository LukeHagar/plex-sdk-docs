## Log Multi Line

This endpoint allows for the batch addition of log entries to the main Plex Media Server log.  
It accepts a text/plain request body, where each line represents a distinct log entry.  
Each log entry consists of URL-encoded key-value pairs, specifying log attributes such as 'level', 'message', and 'source'.  

Log entries are separated by a newline character (`\n`).  
Each entry's parameters should be URL-encoded to ensure accurate parsing and handling of special characters.  
This method is efficient for logging multiple entries in a single API call, reducing the overhead of multiple individual requests.  

The 'level' parameter specifies the log entry's severity or importance, with the following integer values:
- `0`: Error - Critical issues that require immediate attention.
- `1`: Warning - Important events that are not critical but may indicate potential issues.
- `2`: Info - General informational messages about system operation.
- `3`: Debug - Detailed information useful for debugging purposes.
- `4`: Verbose - Highly detailed diagnostic information for in-depth analysis.

The 'message' parameter contains the log text, and 'source' identifies the log message's origin (e.g., an application name or module).

Example of a single log entry format:
`level=4&message=Sample%20log%20entry&source=applicationName`

Ensure each parameter is properly URL-encoded to avoid interpretation issues.
